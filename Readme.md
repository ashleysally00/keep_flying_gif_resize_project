## The Challenge and Solution

I created a gif of a flying butterfly using frame-by-frame animation techniques in Photoshope and Procreate. Then I decided I wanted to analyze and try ro resize it using python. 
When I first attempted to resize the GIF, I encountered an unexpected issue. Here's what happened:

### The Problem

In my original "Gif_Keep_Flying.gif", the butterfly appeared to be flying smoothly. This effect was achieved by showing only one butterfly in one position at any given time. Each subsequent frame would show what looked like the same butterfly, but in a slightly different position, creating the illusion of movement.

However, when I initially resized the GIF, the result was quite different. Instead of seeing a single butterfly moving across the frame, I saw all the positions of the flying butterfly displayed simultaneously. This completely ruined the flying effect, as the butterfly no longer appeared to move - instead, it looked like multiple static butterflies were present on the screen at once.

### Understanding the Issue

I realized that the resizing process was somehow losing the frame disposal information. In the original GIF, each frame was likely set to clear the previous frame before drawing the next one. This crucial detail was being lost during resizing, causing all frames to accumulate and display at once.

### The Solution

To fix this, we needed a resizing method that would preserve the frame disposal method of the original GIF. Here's the key part of the script that addresses this issue:

```python
if img.disposal_method == 2:  # 2 means clear to background
    frame = frame.convert("RGBA")
    if "transparency" in img.info:
        frame.putalpha(frame.getchannel("A").point(lambda x: 0 if x == img.info["transparency"] else x))
```

This code ensures that for frames with a disposal method of 2 (which means "clear to background"), we handle the transparency correctly. By doing this for each frame, we maintain the original behavior where only one butterfly position is visible at a time.

### The Result

After implementing this solution, the resized GIF behaved just like the original. Once again, I could see a single butterfly that appeared to move smoothly across the frame, recreating the flying effect I originally had.

This experience taught me the importance of frame disposal methods in animated GIFs and how crucial they are for creating smooth animations, especially for effects like my flying butterfly.
